## Design Principles

### Philosophy
- Avoid the boring middle. Either minimal/restrained OR bold/expressive - never generic.
- Every design choice should feel intentional, not default.
- If it looks like a template or "AI-generated," it's wrong.
- Custom/branded UI over platform conventions. The product should have its own identity.

### Spacing
- Generous whitespace. Let things breathe.
- When unsure, add more space, not less.
- Vertical rhythm matters - sections should feel like chapters, not a continuous wall.

### Layout
- Contained/centered content with margins. Not edge-to-edge.
- Comfortable with asymmetry and experimentation.
- Clear section breaks - use color changes, generous gaps, or visual shifts to signal "new section."
- Fewer screens with more content (for apps).

### Typography
- Sans-serif by default, serif when it serves the project.
- Avoid safe/generic font pairings. Be intentional.
- Mixing type styles is fine when done with purpose.

### Visual Style (Context-Dependent)

**For minimal/personal/content-focused projects:**
- Let restraint be the personality
- Minimal navigation, no decorative elements
- The content IS the design
- No borders, no cards with shadows, no boxes

**For brand-forward/commercial/playful projects:**
- The UI itself can have personality
- Color blocking, hand-drawn elements, texture welcome
- Typography can be expressive
- Still needs breathing room between sections

### Motion & Animation
- Animations are good - can be expressive, not just functional.
- Sections should "roll out" - feel like discovery, not bombardment.
- Scroll experience matters.

### What To Avoid
- Boxy, grid-heavy layouts that feel like a template
- Drop shadows and bordered cards (unless truly necessary)
- Safe, predictable structure (hero → three cards → CTA → footer)
- Samey sections that blur together
- Stock photo energy
- The generic middle ground

### Reference Sites
- katherinepihl.com - minimal frame, lets work speak
- danmiloch.com - warm restraint, confident simplicity
- thememo.com.au - bold but breathable, great section rhythm

### The Test
"Does this feel like something I've seen a million times, or does it have a point of view?"

## Code & Tech

### Preferences
- Framework/tools: whatever is best for the product
- Design and style are a priority - don't sacrifice aesthetics for convenience
- Default stack if no strong reason otherwise: Vercel, Supabase, Resend
- Open to trying whatever works best

### Style
- Naming: kebab-case for files
- Comments: minimal - code should be self-explanatory
- Keep things clean - avoid unnecessary technical debt
- Dependencies: fine with using libraries that solve problems well

### Testing
- If you can test things yourself, do it
- Accessibility: nice to have, implement where practical

## Writing & Copy

### Tone
- Casual, not formal
- Australian: laidback, relaxed, approachable
- Personality in microcopy - not invisible/robotic
- Some humor, but not tryhard or over the top
- Come across as human

### Humor Style
- Mix of: dry/deadpan, playful, self-deprecating
- Wry observations over loud jokes
- Personality should feel natural, not forced

## Process

### How I Work
- Usually solo
- Building: products, content sites, tools

### What I Want From Claude
- Show me a more complete draft - I'll know what I don't like when I see it
- Ask clarifying questions - I like discussing trade-offs
- Make reasonable assumptions to keep momentum

### Shipping Philosophy
- New project: ship fast, iterate
- Existing project (more than a few days old): do it right
- Keep things clean over accumulating debt

### Platform
- Mobile-first vs desktop-first: depends on the product

---

## Git

- Commit style: whatever makes sense in context
- No strong preference on commit message format
